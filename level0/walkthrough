In level0 we are faced with an executable that running it without argument crash
	./level0
		Segmentation fault (core dumped)

running it with any argument I tried gave me an 'No !'
	./level0 42
		No !

So lets fire GBD and have a closer look
	> gdb -q level0
	> b main
	> disas main
		Dump of assembler code for function main:
	This will shows us the source code in assembly language, we can note that there are 8 function calls
	and the first called function is atoi, so I deduce that the prgram is probably expectin a number <great>
0x08048ed9 <+25>:	cmp    eax,0x1a7
0x08048ede <+30>:	jne    0x8048f58 <main+152>
	we know by convention that the return of a function will be stored in (eax/rax <32/64-bit>)
	so if the return from atoi is not eqaul to 0x1a7 (423)
