In level0 we are faced with an executable that running it without argument crash
	$ ./level0
		Segmentation fault (core dumped)

running it with any argument I tried gave me an 'No !'
	$ ./level0 42
		No !

So lets fire GBD and have a closer look
	$ gdb -q level0
	$ b main
	$ disas main
		Dump of assembler code for function main:
	This will shows us the source code in assembly language, we can note that there are 8 function calls
	and the first called function is atoi, so I deduce that the prgram is probably expectin a number <great>
0x08048ed9 <+25>:	cmp    eax,0x1a7
0x08048ede <+30>:	jne    0x8048f58 <main+152>
	we know by convention that the return of a function will be stored in (eax/rax <32/64-bit>)
	in the next instruction we can read if the return from atoi is not eqaul to 0x1a7 (423) jmp to 0x8048f58
0x08048f58 <+152>:	mov    eax,ds:0x80ee170
	here is where it will jumb if the number is not equal to 0x1a7 (423)
	if we  examine this address
x/i 0x80ee170
	 0x80ee170 <stderr>:	mov    al,ds:0x40080ee7
	 we can see the stderr  and that 7 lines below there is the call to fwrite, so it should be the message we get
	 when we enter other thatn 423.
	 If we don't jump and check the next instruction right after the jne:
0x08048ee0 <+32>:	mov    DWORD PTR [esp],0x80c5348
	if we examine the hex value being moved to esp as an string we get:
 x/s 0x80c5348
 	0x80c5348:	 "/bin/sh"
	right after that there's a call to to strdup, following we can see a call to getegid and  geteuid for getting
	group and user id, next a call to set those values are made, a little down we see another call to <execv> just after
	the mov eax, ds:0x80c5348 that contains 0x80c5348:	 "/bin/sh"

	This is exec command will execute a new shell where we can run the command:

$ cat /home/user/level1/.pass
1fe8a524fa4bec01ca4ea2a869af2a02260d4a7d5fe7e7c24d8617e6dca12d3a

	and we get the flag, Ctrl+D to leave the shell and type:
$ su level1
